							 <br>
							 <p>
							 Navigating a large, complex sprawl of land is often difficult for those unacquainted with the premises. This is particularly true on the campus of UTM, where first-year students and—due to the COVID-19 pandemic—latter year students alike have not yet gained a familiarity to the layout of the university.

							<p>
							 Through the observations recorded below, we’ve concluded that in order to create the solution the navigational application must have three main features: locating people, locating buildings and classrooms, and locating dining options.

		  <h5>About 'FindUTM':</h5>  
		  <br>
		  <p >
		  My team and I have designed an interface for a UTM campus navigation app that will help students navigate issues such as connecting with friends, finding buildings and classrooms, and finding food locations on campus. This app includes precise mapping of the UTM campus – specifically the layout of each building’s interior – as well as real time directions, messaging, and calling features.

					<h4>Plan:</h4>
					 <br>
					 <p>
					Through our qualitative analysis of the observations conducted, three key narratives have been identified: an uncertainty of whether the subject is within their desired location, the utilization of a mobile device to remedy navigational issues, and utilizing another individual to search for their desired location. These coincide with the three most popular solutions employed by subjects: a trial and error approach where they will hesitantly search a variety of locations, asking another individual for help, or the utilization of a mobile device. To alleviate these navigational troubles, a prospective application will be developed wherein its elements of usability should alleviate or improve upon these aforementioned narratives. To improve upon the issue of uncertainties, one of this prospective application’s main goals should focus on improving the user’s navigational ability, thus increasing their confidence. Further, this application should streamline the usage of a mobile device to remedy navigational issues. That is, the app should have a primary focus towards navigation, and it should not be overly complex in order to decrease the amount of attention required to operate the application. Finally, the app should possess the ability to interact with others. To elaborate, a user should be able to contact a desired individual if the application’s features are insufficient in properly alleviating the navigational troubles of the user.

			<h4>User Observations:</h4>
			 <br>
			 <p>
			 The purpose of these observations is to examine how UTM students currently navigate campus to find locations or people. To do this, we observed the behaviour of twenty UTM students from afar in multiple locations on campus. The users listed below were chosen at random in each building because we wanted to observe how students acted and interacted within these spaces, and whether navigational issues would arise at any point. In this sample, we’ve also made note of users who were situated in the area but didn’t necessarily have navigational issues. We thought this could inform us about the solutions students have already created for themselves, and how we could integrate those solutions into our design. For the most part, we watched individuals who were alone. In the few mentions of groups down below, we’ve categorized them as single users because they exhibited similar behavior within their company.We sat in the library, classrooms, hallways, dining and common areas around campus to observe the behavior of students who were navigating the area and/or trying to find other students. We took notice of body language, facial expressions, use of cell phones, and dialogue.
			<br>
			 <br>
			 Observational Insights
				 <br>
			Through the observations gathered from this sample, we have concluded that the main problem was related to navigating campus in order to find both locations and people. 
			Many users relied on their phones to help them accomplish this, and were seen texting or making phone calls to describe their location and/or appearance. Other users used a trial and error approach, in which they aimlessly walked through various areas to find their desired location or person. We observed that the latter approach induced some discomfort within the users, as seen from their anxious, awkward, or distressed body language. Many of them exhibited hesitancy or a lack of confidence in their navigational process.

					<h4>Design Goals:</h4>  
						  <br>
						  <p class="text-white">
						Simplistic Design
						<br>
						Through the observations that had been gathered, 7/20 of the observed subjects would conduct other tasks (i.e. scanning an area) while using their phone in an attempt to remedy navigational issues. Therefore the application should be designed with a simplistic user interface in an effort to decrease the amount of attention required to operate the application. In general, the user will primarily focus on their surroundings, simply using the application as a guide towards their desired location. Therefore a simplistic design will encourage the user to focus less on the application, and more on their surroundings.
						<br>
						<br>

						Basic Text &#38; Call Features
						<br>
						One fifth of observed users had attempted to use another individual to search for their desired location. Thus the application should host basic texting and calling features, allowing the user to contact these other prospective individuals without leaving the application. This will further enhance the user’s confidence in their navigational ability, as they will be able to verify their location relative to their desired target location (if it is a person). Such a feature will also decrease the need to open other applications (such as a user’s calling and messaging applications), as it can be assumed that should a user be unable to reach a specific individual, they will call or text them.
						<br>
						<br>

						Ability to View Active Students and Request their Location
						<br>
						7/20 of the observed individuals had shown visible signs of uncertainty regarding whether or not they were within their desired location. With regards to if this location is the vicinity of another student, the application should allow the user to view currently active students, and to further allow them to request the student’s location. Such a feature will streamline the usage of the application, as the user will be able to seamlessly search through all currently active users, and then request their location. This feature also allows a certain level of privacy to be maintained, as it will allow the target student to reject the user’s request for their location. Further, this feature will extend upon alleviating the observed issue of using another individual to aid in their search, as they could asynchronously request for their target’s location.
						<br>
						<br>
						Ability to View Directions to a Selected Location
							  <br>
						As previously described, 7/20 of the observed individuals had shown visible signs of uncertainty with regards to their current location and whether it is their desired location. To alleviate this issue, the user should be able to view directions to a selected location. That is, after selecting either a campus location or student’s location, the application should then display directions towards the target. Further, a map should be present that will also display both the distance and estimated time it will take to reach the user’s target location. This feature will increase the user’s confidence in their navigational abilities, as they will be able to clearly view their target location relative to their own location in a visual format (a map), as well as both the distance and estimated time it will take to reach their target.

									<h4>Usability Testing:</h4>
									 <br>
									<p>
									Summary of Protocol
                                    <br>
									<br>
									Our usability evaluation protocol was conducted in three main parts: the pre-testing questions, interface scenario run-throughs, and the post-testing questionnaire. We conducted testing sessions with 12 users.
									<br>
									<br>

									The pre-testing consists of five questions to give us more insight about our users’ familiarity with campus, their past and current navigational issues, and their solutions to them.
									<br>
									<br>

									The interface scenario run-throughs consist of four subsections which were used to test our interface’s main features: Find a Friend, Find Buildings &#38; Classrooms, Find Food, and User Support features (FAQ, privacy notice, user profile). We prepared charts to record our observations for each of these features. Each chart corresponds to a different scenario that tested the usability of each feature. The purpose of these charts is to observe the users’ body language, thoughts, timing, and ease while navigating the different screens and buttons.
									<br>
									<br>
									Lastly, we asked each user to complete an anonymous post-testing questionnaire where they can evaluate button visibility, navigational ease of our interface, overall experience, and give them the opportunity to write down their general comments. We set up a questionnaire corner in our workstation to give them privacy when completing this part of the process. 

									<br>
			
									</p>

								<div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6 col-xl-6 padding-top">
									<p>
									Summary of Testing Sessions
									<br>
									<br>

									Throughout our testing sessions, users often commented on how straightforward and simple the app was to navigate for the functions that it sought to use. In the first testing session, the prototype was hand drawn to show the basic functions to see how users reacted to interface details such as button placement, functionality and any glaring issues that weren’t seen in the ideation stage. At that point, users commented most on consistency and placement issues for buttons, specifically the return to home button. Later on, as the prototypes increased fidelity, users had more to say about placement of other features such as the privacy notice. Icons were also found to be a consistent issue for users, as three of four users commented on how difficult it was to differentiate between the personal profile icon and the privacy notice icon on the toolbar. In later iterations, this was resolved through changing the icons until it was decided that it would be more beneficial to migrate the privacy statement to the frequently asked questions section. In the final testing sessions, users found greater success in locating it this way. 
									<br>
									<br>

									In early testing sessions, participants were invited to participate through direct conversations with members of the developer team. For later testing sessions, they were asked to participate with incentives, though a few refused them after testing ended. They were given anonymity for anything recorded, and asked for consent to be recorded during testing. After that, they followed predesigned testing protocols to test for visibility and usability of the proposed app design.
